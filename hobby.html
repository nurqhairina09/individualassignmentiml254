<p>Yes, as expected, my hobby is reading books while listening to musics. Basically, I like to read both books and online material. At first, I used to read stories on media platforms like Instagram, X, or Wattpad, but as I grew older, I had enough money to buy books that piqued my interest. For me, reading is a relaxing and therapeutic activity that helps me to relieve stress. Indirectly, it's like I am escaping reality and focusing solely on the fantasy of the book I am currently reading. In addition, reading while listening to music is also beneficial to me because it allows me to become more immersed in the content. Not to mention that I enjoy collecting books, particularly novels, and I recently visited Pesta Buku Antarabangsa Kuala Lumpur (PBAKL) to add some books to my collection. Among the genres I am interested in are action, fantasy, thriller and of course romance. Thus, I have included a playlist that I always listen to while reading books. I hope you guys like it.

<p>Personal interest are common among all people. To be honest, I have a variety of personal interests, but these are the only I typically do.
<p>
According to the image, my personal interests are;
<p>
<ul>
    <li>Hiking
    <li>Dancing
    <li>Watching Korean Drama
</ul>
<p>
Basically, when I have free time, I will go hiking with my friends. I enjoy nature and challenging activities, so I don't mind if the hill I am hiking is a little challenging. However, due to my busy schedule with my studies, I have been hiking less, maybe I will restart this activity after I take a break. Next interest is dancing, which I have enjoyed since I was a kid. When I was in elementary school, I went to a lot of dance performances, and perhaps because I like K-POP, I enjoy dancing more. Fun fact, my family has no idea I enjoy dancing because I usually dance or practice alone or with my friends. Last but not least, watching Korean drama. I believe that Korean drama is appealing to everyone. I have been watching Korean dramas since I was a kid, and I am familiar with their plots because I rarely see local stories (Malay dramas). Basically, I will watch Kdrama when I have free time and can finish 16 episodes in only one day.
