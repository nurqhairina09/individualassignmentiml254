<p>To be honest, after graduating from high school, I looked for a job to fill my free time while waiting for the SPM results. For me, making something work was preferable than sitting at home. With that, I will be able to earn my own money while also learning and experiencing new things. As a result, I will be more alert and responsible when doing work, and I will be able to apply this knowledge later when working in a real-world setting. Thus, while waiting for my SPM results, I worked two jobs which as a teacher at Little Caliphs and as a customer service at Oldtown White Coffee. 
<p>	My first job was as a teacher at Little Caliphs. Actually, I got this job from an elementary school friend who messaged me about working with her in kindergarten.Coincidentally, there was a vacant position, so I applied for it, and alhamdulillah, I got it. I really enjoy working as a teacher in an environment filled with children. I love kids, so the workload does not bother me. My job is as a teacher, looking after and teaching children aged one to three years old. Essentially, I was a babysitter and also a teacher for them. However, I only worked for just over a month and changed to another job. In short, my work as a teacher taught me a lot about patience and cultivated my compassionate side. I am grateful to be a teacher, and I will cherish this experience even though I only worked for a short time. 
<p>	My second job was as a customer service for OldTown White Coffee. To be honest, I didn't expect to be working in the F&B department because I am afraid of interacting with strangers and this was my first time in the food industry. At first, I started working with my friend, but she quit after a few days, and I'm still doing this job because I wanted to try new things. After a few days of work, I began to feel more comfortable in my new surroundings. Even though the work period is longer than the previous one, but I enjoy it because I am excited to seeing the customer on that particular day. Fun fact, I was the only Malay in the customer service department; the others were Chinese. But that didn't stop me from making friends, and they were very helpful, nice, and taught me how to manage my work. If you look at the picture, there is a Chinese auntie who always teaches me and corrects me when I make mistakes. I initially thought she was intimidating, but she was actually very nice and always talk to me. She was deaf and couldn't speak, so I learned to use sign language to communicate with her. In brief, I only had two months of work experience before starting my study journey.
